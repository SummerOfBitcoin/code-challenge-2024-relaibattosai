**Design Approach: Constructing a Valid Block**

In designing the block construction program, several key concepts were considered to ensure the creation of a valid block. Here's an overview of the approach taken:

1. **Transaction Inputs and Outputs:**
   - Transactions consist of inputs and outputs.
   - Inputs are validated by ensuring there is a record of the money being spent.
   - Outputs are validated to ensure the sum of inputs is greater than the sum of outputs.

2. **Address Types and Signature Scripts:**
   - Different address types have distinct signature scripts.
   - For Pay-to-Public-Key-Hash (P2PKH), the signature script contains the actual public key and signature.
   - Pay-to-Script-Hash (P2SH) transactions involve a witness containing the actual public key and signature.
   - For Segregated Witness (SegWit) addresses like v0_P2WPKH and v0_P2WSH, specific witness and hashed public key formats are used.

3. **Transaction Validation Rules:**
   - Each transaction must have a unique input, ensuring double spends are avoided.
   - The decoded version of the address must match the hashed public address.
   - Transactions with a sequence set to 0xFFFFFFFF but not reaching their lock time are considered invalid.

4. **Block Construction Process:**
   - Transactions are organized into a DataFrame structure, with inputs in a DataFrame named STXO and outputs in another named UTXO.
   - Each transaction belongs to a specific block, identified by a block ID that ties all DataFrames together.
   - Invalid transactions are filtered out based on predefined criteria for validity.
   - A candidate block DataFrame is created, incorporating variables such as the version, previous block hash, merkle root, current time, bits, and nonce.
   - The merkle root is computed from the transaction data, and the block hash is generated by hashing the block header.
   - The final valid block is written to an output text file, containing transaction details from STXO and UTXO, along with the block header from the candidate block DataFrame.

The design approach prioritized simplicity, clarity, and adherence to blockchain validation rules, ensuring the resulting block is compliant with the network's consensus rules.

**Implementation Details: Pseudocode**


```pseudo
1. Process Transactions:
    - Process the transactions data to obtain STXO (spent transaction outputs) and UTXO (unspent transaction outputs).
    - Identify and exclude OP_RETURN transactions from UTXO as they are considered invalid.
    - Identify and exclude unknown transactions (e.g., multisig) from UTXO.
    - Drop duplicate inputs from STXO, keeping only the first occurrence.
    - Group the sum of money spent by block in input and output transactions.
    - Remove blocks where the difference between input and output values is zero (no fees) or negative (overspending).

2. Validate Transactions:
    - Iterate through each spent transaction output (STXO).
    - Check if the output value exists in the list of values associated with the output address.
    - Mark transactions with invalid output values as unchecked.
    - Remove blocks that have any unchecked transactions.

3. Extract Transaction Hashes:
    - Initialize an empty DataFrame to store transaction hashes (tx_hash).
    - Iterate through each spent transaction output (STXO):
        - Extract relevant information for each transaction.
        - Compute script assembly for each output in the transaction.
        - Create a DataFrame for the current transaction and append it to the list of DataFrames.
    - Concatenate all DataFrames to create the transaction hash DataFrame (tx_hash).
    - Compute the transaction hash digest for each transaction using provided function.

4. Compute Merkle Root:
    - Group transaction IDs by block ID to obtain a list of transaction IDs for each block.
    - Compute the Merkle root for each block using the list of transaction IDs.
    - Merge the Merkle root with corresponding inputs in STXO DataFrame.

5. Create Candidate Block DataFrame (Block Header):
    - Construct a DataFrame containing information necessary for a candidate block.
    - Calculate the difficulty bits from the difficulty target.
    - Ensure that the block hash is less than the difficulty target to mine a valid block if it isn't, increase the nonce value till it is

6. Output the mined blocks
    - Loop through UTXO, STXO, and the candidate block DataFrame:
        - Extract necessary headers, inputs, and outputs for those with a common block ID.
    - Output the candidate block DataFrame to 'output.txt'.
    
6. Print Status:
    - Print the status indicating the completion 

7. End.
```

**Results and Performance**

The solution successfully generates the output in the 'output.txt' file, containing the constructed candidate block with validated transactions. Each block in the output adheres to the rules of a valid block, including transaction verification, Merkle root computation, and block hash mining. The dataframe approach proved to be efficient for handling the large volume of transactions, which numbered over 8000. Despite the size of the dataset, the dataframe operations such as filtering, grouping, and merging were performed seamlessly, demonstrating the efficiency of this approach in managing structured data.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, through this project, I gained valuable insights into various aspects of blockchain technology, including transaction validity rules, hashing techniques, signature extraction, public key hashing, address generation and a lot more. While working on the project, I focused primarily on single-signature transactions and did not delve into multisignature or taproot transactions due to time constraints and limited available resources. The time constraint did not also allow me to verify that the signature, public key and digest belong together even though I was able to extract these variables. For a more robust, validation scheme, these are aspects that will definitely neeed looking into. The resources consulted during the problem-solving process included online tutorials, blockchain explorers, and documentation such as:
